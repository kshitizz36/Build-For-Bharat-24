## Problem Statement

#### Optimal storage & retrieval in m*n sparse matrix 
##### Pincode based serviceability allows merchants to define the pincodes where they can deliver their products & services;
In ONDC, definition & verification of pincode based serviceability is separated, i.e. merchants define the pincodes they serve and buyer apps verify whether a particular pincode (of buyer) can be served by any of the available merchants;
Considering there are more than 30K pincodes and at least 100 million merchants (of which about 10% may enable pincode based serviceability), this requires an optimal data structure for storing the pincode serviceability by merchant (i.e. a sparse matrix of 10M*30K) so that verification is near real-time.
